## Default Blocked Sites

The extension comes with these common distracting sites pre-configured:
- Facebook
- YouTube  
- Twitter
- Instagram
- TikTok
- Reddit

You can easily add or remove any of these sites.

## How It Works

### Focus Mode
- When **enabled**: All blocked websites redirect to a "Stay Focused" page
- When **disabled**: All websites are accessible normally
- **No timer needed** - simply toggle on/off as needed

### Website Blocking
- Uses Chrome's `declarativeNetRequest` API for efficient blocking
- Creates dynamic rules that can be easily modified
- Works across all browser tabs and windows

### Data Storage
- **Settings**: Stored in `chrome.storage.sync` (syncs across devices)
- **Blocked Sites**: Stored in `chrome.storage.local`
- **Focus Statistics**: Tracks daily focus time and streaks

## Technical Details

- **Manifest V3** - Built with the latest Chrome extension standards
- **Service Worker** - Background script manages blocking rules
- **Storage APIs** - Uses Chrome's built-in storage for data persistence
- **Declarative Rules** - Efficient website blocking without performance impact

## Privacy

- **No data collection** - All data stays on your device
- **No tracking** - Extension doesn't monitor your browsing
- **Local storage** - Your blocked sites list is private
- **Open source** - Code is transparent and auditable

## Troubleshooting

### Focus Mode Not Working
- Check that the extension has permission to access all URLs
- Try disabling and re-enabling the extension
- Verify that sites are added to your blocked list

### Sites Still Accessible
- Ensure focus mode is enabled (button should be red)
- Check that the site domain is in your blocked list
- Try refreshing the page or opening in a new tab

### Extension Not Loading
- Check Chrome's extension page for error messages
- Try reloading the extension
- Ensure you're using a compatible Chrome version
